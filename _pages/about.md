Hi! I am a young data science enthusiast. I like playing around with data to learn and discover new things. This place would serve as a single point of source to all my projects. 

I hold a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. Before that, I pursued my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from VIT Vellore, India. 

I am an outdoor enthusiast. I like hiking, running, and biking. I like going bouldering with friends and recently started doing calisthenics as strength training. 

I also enjoy playing music on my guitar. I mostly play fingerstyle guitar. I hear a lot of country music and love to learn and play amazing riffs!
